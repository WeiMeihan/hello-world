This is my first repository in GitHub.
I uploaded one of my python homework in Bioinformatics course to prove my coding ability.

Document:
DEG.py process gene expression data for smokers and non-smokers and figure out deferential expressed genes in smokers.
report.pdf gives a report of what I analysed from gene expression data.
